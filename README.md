# Machine Learning algorithms

Code for the machine learning algorithms in the book "Machine Learning" by Tom Mitchell. The main purpose for this is to help with understanding the algorithms.

Python implementation for the following algorithms including simple use case on basic datasets.

* Concept Learning
  * Find-S
  * Candidate Elimination

* Decision Tree
  * ID3

* Rule Based Learning
  * Sequential Covering
  * One Rule Beam Search
 
* Bayesian Learning
  * Naive Bayes
 
* Instance Based Learning
  * K-Nearest Neighbors

* Neural Networks
  * Perceptron
  * Neural Network

* Evolutionary Algorithms
  * Genetic Algorithm

* Ensemble Learning
  * Weighted Majority

## Getting Started

Steps for running the acceptance tests.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest test/acceptance_tests
```
